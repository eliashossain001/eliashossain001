### Md. Elias Hossain 
Experience in graduate-level Software Engineering research. Extensively published in international journals, conference with related expertise in Computer Science and Software Engineering. My research interest focuses on various intelligent systems, and I am also very keen to learn more about this. My background education and research exposure during my research career have honed my skill sets to approach a problem from various perspectives. I graduated from Daffodil International University, Dhaka-Bangladesh. In my senior year, I was fortunate to work with the various research project at my department from where I learned the art of research. My research field is mainly on the Computer Science domain. Now I am working with Machine Learning & NLP. There's certainly yet more to learn, yet more problems to solve, and yet more to build. And for this, I am very grateful.
